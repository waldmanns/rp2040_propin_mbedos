## A simple prop signal reading program for RP2040 based arduino using interrupts
After trying multiple libraries I always encountered errors, non working pins or performance issues. 
While digging through mbedOS documentation and related forums (thanks to user haplm) I've put togheter this, in order to process my 5 channel receiver data.

The implementation only uses mbedOS provided functions, is easy and blazing fast

I don't actively use or develop for the RP2040, this was made only for evaluation purposes
